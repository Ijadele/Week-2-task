            How have you been? I hope you're doing good. What about
            your Family? I hope they are also doing great! Well, I'm 
            writing this letter in letting you know about the future
            of work as regards how technology is disrupting almost every 
            sector.

            Automation allows workers to focus on more important tasks like solving problems,
             designing products, and interpreting data. 
            Automation is not only changing the nature of work but also how work is done.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, employers will seek out
             candidates that can continuously learn new skills. My good
             friend, let's keep up with our skills. My regards to the 
             family.Take care.
